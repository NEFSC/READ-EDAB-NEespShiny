## Introduction
Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) are a scientific product to support [Integrated Ecosystem Assessment](https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/) (IEA). IEA seeks to improve understanding and management of fisheries through incorporating natural, social, and economic data into fisheries analyses and management plans. ESPs are a structured framework developed by the Alaska Science Center to integrate ecosystem and socioeconomic information into the stock assessment process.<sup>[1]</sup>


Here we adapt the ESP process for use in the management of Northeast stocks. Our scientific roadmap consists of these steps:
1. Gather existing data on ecology, biology, socioeconomics, and the human dimension of Northeast fisheries.
2. Conduct a risk analysis of Northeast stocks to determine which stocks are most vulnerable.
3. Create a detailed report for the most vulnerable stocks, incorporating data from the originial risk assessment as well as detailed species-specific information.

## Shiny App
This branch houses a Shiny app that will provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ESP data visualization and report generation. At this point in time, the Shiny app is not operational, but progress will be recorded here.

## Next steps
We continue to synthesize existing data on Northeast stocks, environment, and socioeconomics. We are currently refining our data analyses and beginning the preliminary risk assessment process.
